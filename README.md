# Hide-Chat-Button-Updated
(WoW Retail 12.0.0 Addon) This button will hide the chat interface. It hangs out in the lower left corner, and a click will toggle the chat panels on or off.

The Original was made by Phemoir https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17691-HideChatButton.html

But it wasnt Updated and wont work with 12.0.0
